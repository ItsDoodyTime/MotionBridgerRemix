TL;DR of this section is:
- if you know how to code in python, download vpngremix-dev-pack.zip
- if you don't know how to code, download vpngremix.exe

Long version:
    Dev Pack:
        - This includes EVERYTHING I used in the development process.
        - It is very small inf file size since it's just the the source code.
        - You need install python and dependencies YOURSELF. (I recommend doing it in a Virtual Environment.)

        Use this version if you want to customize the code, or if your model is super advanced.
        This just means if you don't know how to code, you need to learn and make your own script.

        Dependencies to download:
            - Python (Program Language)
            - OpenCV-Python (Core System - enabling some optimizations, allowing webcam use, and smoother functions)
            - MediaPipe (Motion Tracking)
            - Websocket-Client (Needed to connect to websockets)
            - Numpy (for quick math and arrays)

    vpngremix.exe:
        - This is a onefile version that comes with all the dependencies and python bundled.
        - It is as simple as install, configure, and run. :)
        - It has SOME optimzations (though idk what im doing so it might not make a difference lol)
        - It is smaller in size, but still larger than you would expect a translator script to be, due to it being a CV project.
        - It limits you to the config file, so if I haven't added a feature or "sprite part", you can't change its values. :/

What version of PNGTubeRemix do i need for this tool?
    - 1.4.1 or higher

"...." is not working
    - Read the "COMMON MISTAKES" section below.

Will this work with my operating system?
    - dunno. try and see! (I've only tested Windows.)

I tried to run it but the tool doesn't launch...
    - Some antivirus softwares might block it because of false positives.

Is this safe to run?
    - Yes! You might get a "Windows Protected your PC." warning, and that's expected!
    It's because this .exe is not codesigned. (which costs a good amount of money and im broke. lol)

How do i gracefully close the program?
    - Press Escape.

I don't have a webcam, can i use my phone as a virtual camera?
    - Yes. just change the webcam index in config.json
    - or if you have downloaded the Dev Pack, change it in the source code.

Do it jiggle?
    - ......... YURRR! B-)

MORE FAQ COMING SOON! (maybe... depends if i feel like updating this.)

"Camera doesn't open/is unavailable."
    This is due to:
        - Camera already being used by another app.
        - Wrong camera index in code.

"WebSocket connection fails/couldn't start."
    This is due to:
        - PNGTubeRemix not running **OR** if it is running, the websocket server is not started.
        - The websocket port has changed in PNGTubeRemix
        - Your Firewall is blocking "localhost"

"Movement feels jittery/snappy and animations have low frame rate."
    This is due to:
        - The SEND_INTERVAL is set to a higher value than the default
