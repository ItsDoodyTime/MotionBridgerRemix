What version of PNGTubeRemix do i need for this tool?
    - 1.4.1 or higher

"...." is not working
    - Read the "COMMON MISTAKES" section below.

Will this work with my operating system?
    - dunno. try and see! (I've only tested Windows.)

I tried to run it but the tool doesn't launch...
    - Some antivirus softwares might block it because of false positives.

Is this safe to run?
    - Yes! You might get a "Windows Protected your PC." warning, and that's expected!
    It's because this .exe is not codesigned. (which costs a good amount of money and im broke. lol)

How do i gracefully close the program?
    - Press Escape.

I don't have a webcam, can i use my phone as a virtual camera?
    - Yes. just change the webcam index in config.json
    - or if you have downloaded the Dev Pack, change it in the source code.

Do it jiggle?
    - ......... YURRR! B-)

MORE FAQ COMING SOON! (maybe... depends if i feel like updating this.)

        - The websocket port has changed in PNGTubeRemix
        - Your Firewall is blocking "localhost"
