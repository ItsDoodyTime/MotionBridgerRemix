## What do you need?

**Just art of your character and [PNGTubeRemix](https://github.com/MudkipWorld/PNGTuber-Remix).** That’s it!

That said, rigging specifically for tracking will give **better results**.<br>
If that's something you're interested in, check the tool's documentation to understand how you can get the best tracking results! :)
