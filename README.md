- People interested in streaming, PNGTubing, VTubing, and rigging models.
- PNGTubeRemix Users

If you want a VTuber-style model but:
- don’t want to spend hundreds on rigging,
- feel overwhelmed by Live2D or VTube Studio,
- or just want something lightweight and flexible,

**This tool is for you!**

---

## What do you need?

**Just art of your character and [PNGTubeRemix](https://github.com/MudkipWorld/PNGTuber-Remix).** That’s it!

- This tool was made for PNGTubeRemix, **it WON'T work without it!**
- Your PNG **does not need to be specifically rigged for tracking** — standard PNGTuber rigs work just fine.
> - "Standard" meaning: Your PNGTuber Model's sprites/layers need to have simple names ***IF*** You want MBR to Auto-Configure everything. (Ex: Head = ✓ | 1234Head-with-Mask = ✘)<br>
> - If you don't have simple names for your sprites/layers, you can enter advanced mode and confgirue things yourself in the UI.<br>
> ⚠️ Your sprites cannot have empty spaces in their names.

That said, rigging specifically for tracking will give **better results**.<br>
If that's something you're interested in, check the tool's documentation to understand how you can get the best tracking results! :)
