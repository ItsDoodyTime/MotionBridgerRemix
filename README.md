- People interested in VTubing, streaming, and rigging models.
- PNGTubeRemix Users

If you want a VTuber-style model but:
- don’t want to spend hundreds on rigging,
- feel overwhelmed by Live2D or VTube Studio,
- or just want something lightweight and flexible,

**This tool is for you!**

---

## What do you need?

**Just art of your character and [PNGTubeRemix](https://github.com/MudkipWorld/PNGTuber-Remix).** That’s it!

- This tool was made for PNGTubeRemix, **it WON'T work without it!**
- Your PNG **does not need to be specifically rigged for tracking** — standard PNGTuber rigs work just fine.

That said, rigging specifically for tracking will give **better results**.

Don't worry! If that's something you're interested in, I will go over the entire rigging process with you in the tool's documentation, to help you get the best tracking results! :)
